				<p>Greetings readers. My name is Derek Greene and I am very new to the world of coding.  I have no experience or knowledge in the subject, but a desire to become a few levels below master.  I am from Morganton, NC originally, where I was raised in the middle of the forest with many of the fauna that inhabits North Carolina; because of this upbringing, I thouroughly enjoy the outdoors and all that is involved with it.  Hiking, fishing, trail riding, and of course, beer.</p>

				<p>I am also a devout believer in God and try to live my life in a manner which is suitable.  This involves volunteering, encouraging others, and assisting the needy in any way applicable.  I hope to use my skills as a web developer to assist churches and non-profits in missions and charities for the less fortunate.  In my freetime, I always enjoy a good television show or a challenging, entertaining videogame.  Pertaining to videogames, I am very competitive and invite any challengers to a match in Mortal Kombat.  If any further details are desired, please email me.</p>
